The file 'doublePendulum.py' contains all methods necessary for the simulation.
The file 'pendulumsimulations.py' contains examples of how to use the methods in doublePendulum.py,
and files 'chaos.py' and 'chaos2.py' contain the code used in the visualization of sensitivity to
initial conditions (they have been modified by lowering the number of pendulum simulations in order
to make the excecution time shorter. Also lines used to save images have been commented).
